GERMANY is changing. A country that long equated belonging with having four grandparents with German names, and treated many immigrants as temporary visitors, has seen a massive influx of foreigners following chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision in 2015 to keep borders open to refugees and asylum-seekers. Uncertainty about the country’s ability to cope with this massive influx, and about its economic future in general, has had a political cost. In last September’s election, Mrs Merkel’s centre-right Christian Democratic Party and its Bavarian partner, the Christian Social Union (CSU), suffered a drop in their share of the vote to a post-war low of 33%. Her partners in the grand coalition that has run the country for eight of her 12 years in power, the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), also saw their support fall, from 26% to 21%. The anti-immigration AfD, formed only in 2013, took third place with 13%. An unprecedented five months of coalition wrangling to form a government ended only on March 4th when SPD members voted to support a new grand coalition with the CDU/CSU. Economically though, Germany would seem to be sitting comfortably. The country has a record trade surplus and record low unemployment and enjoyed a budget surplus of €37bn ($47bn), or 1.1% of GDP, last year. Yet even here some uncertainty is creeping in. Globalisation and technology are hollowing out the German labour market and creating new divides between haves and have-nots. And Germany’s mighty engineering industry, the very driver of its prosperity, is being disrupted by new technologies and competitors that upend old business models. The old vision of what it means to be German is being challenged by changes at home and abroad. See also: “The new Germans”
