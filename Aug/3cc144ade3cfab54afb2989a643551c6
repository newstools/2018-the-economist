AT THE start of this year, we asked readers of Gulliver for their thoughts on where in the world had the worst airports—America or somewhere else. Many of Gulliver’s colleagues and some commenters targeted their ire on Luton airport, just north of London. Last week, the airport was named the worst in Britain for the third year in a row in a survey by Which?, a consumer group. One commenter, “Alex Tunbridge Wells”, suggested that conditions are so bad there, the management must be setting out to make life hellish for travellers going through its departure halls: Gulliver imagines that Nick Barton, the airport’s chief executive, would push back against that description of his boardroom meetings. Passengers have undoubtedly found reasons to grumble during work on a project to expand and refurbish the airport costing £160m ($210m). But many flyers are already admiring the airport’s new arrivals hall, and the rest of the project will soon be complete. Better still, work started earlier this year on a new light-rail connection between the airport terminal and local train station, a trip that used to take up to an hour by bus. This should slash travel times between central London and check-in desk to as little as 30 minutes. So good things come to those who wait—though not in an airport queue.
