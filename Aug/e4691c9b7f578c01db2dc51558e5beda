LITTLE doubt exists as to where The Economist stands on assisted dying. In 2015 we ran a cover calling for laws to be changed in Britain and elsewhere to allow doctors to help the terminally ill and the suffering to choose when they die. We wrote: But as part of our Open Future initiative—in which, for our 175th anniversary, we aim to remake the case for liberalism—we wanted to open up the conversation to both sides, in the spirit of respectful debate. Over the coming two weeks, we will run essays by people who are both for and against assisted dying. We have got a wide range of contributors: from doctors and lawyers who have fought for the right of patients or clients to die as they choose, to medical practitioners and atheists who are opposed to the idea. We include one person who, faced with a terminal cancer diagnosis, is considering taking themselves to Switzerland for an assisted suicide. Contributions come from Guernsey (where a recent attempt to allow assisted dying was squashed), Britain, Canada, Switzerland and Belgium. We will publish two to three articles each day this week; then, in the week beginning August 27th, some of our contributors will respond to one another. We have tried to be as comprehensive as possible, but inevitably we have not managed to include every aspect of this debate, or a voice from every country in which this is an incendiary issue. So we would like to hear from you: in comments (which will be monitored carefully to protect our contributors) or via e-mail, to openfuture@economist.com. What do you think? Should assisted dying be legal? This week’s articles: Steven Fletcher: Dying with dignity is the biggest shift in morality in a generationEmilie Yerby: Guernsey was right to reject assisted dying
