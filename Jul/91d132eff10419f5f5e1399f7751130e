CEASEFIRES in South Sudanâ€™s civil war tend to be short. At least nine such agreements have been signed since the war started in 2013. Only one has lasted longer than a month. The latest ceasefire, agreed to on June 30th, is already in danger of falling apart. On paper it sets the stage for power-sharing talks between President Salva Kiir and rebel leader Riek Machar, a former vice-president. But hours after it took effect both sides reported violations. Analysts say Messrs Kiir and Machar have lost full control of their forces, which have splintered into factions. To make matters worse, Mr Kiir unveiled plans on July 2nd to extend his term by three years, to 2021. The opposition said the move would derail the peace talks.
