ITS name means “heavenly palace”. But Tiangong-1, an eight-tonne Chinese space station launched in 2011, will not remain in the heavens much longer. After visits from crews in 2012 and 2013, Tiangong-1’s mission officially ended in March 2016. A few months later China’s space agency appeared to confirm what amateur skywatchers had already suspected, that it had lost control of the station. It said it expected Tiangong-1 to fall from the sky sometime late in 2017. In fact, the station is still up there, orbiting at an average height of 250km. But the inaccuracy of the agency’s prediction is understandable. At low altitudes (anything under about 2,000km), orbital mechanics is a surprisingly imprecise science. Earth’s thin outer atmosphere exerts a measurable drag on anything in such an orbit, and this drag means that, without regular boosts, that object will fall out of orbit eventually. The drag itself, however, is not constant. The interplay between Earth’s magnetic field and the solar wind and changes in the sun’s activity both affect the density of the outer atmosphere. So exactly when this fiery fall will happen is hard to say in advance. Without knowing when the station will fall, it is impossible to say where those pieces might land, though the characteristics of the station’s orbit mean it will be between latitudes 43° north (that of northern Spain) and 43° south (which passes by Tasmania; see map). Wherever they land, the chance of any debris hitting someone is low. For one thing, the world is mostly ocean. For another, even on land people are small and scarce compared with the available area. Although the risk of injury cannot be ruled out, no one is known to have been injured by re-entering debris since the space age began. Read more in What goes up... from the print edition
