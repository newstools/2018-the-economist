COLLEGES with successful basketball teams tend to see more applications the following year. Research by Devin and Jaren Pope, two economists, has found that colleges whose men’s basketball teams qualified for March Madness, the sport’s championship tournament, saw a 2.4% average increase in the total number of applications, as measured by the number of SAT college-entrance exam results received. Colleges whose teams made the “Final Four” saw a 5.8% increase in applications, while colleges whose teams won the entire tournament saw a 10.9% increase in applications in the year after their victory. Some demographic groups were found to be more responsive to sporting success than others. Women who did not play sports in high school, unsurprisingly, did not seem to care much about colleges’ basketball success. Out-of-state students were more likely to apply to a college based on its performance in March Madness than in-state students were. This suggests that sports teams increase their colleges’ name recognition, rather than merely galvanising high-school students who are already familiar with them. Black students were found to be the most influenced by a college’s basketball success. The researchers’ analysis finds that colleges whose teams manage to win the entire tournament saw an 23.3% increase in applications from black students the following year.
