On March 18th Russia will take to the polls for presidential elections. The result is preordained: Vladimir Putin will win, entitling him to another six years in power. Among those eligible to vote for the first time this year are many born when he first took office on the cusp of the new millennium. This generation—call them the Puteens—has grown up with no memory of life before Mr Putin. The Economist interviewed dozens of 18 year-olds across Russia to hear about how they see the world, understand the past, and imagine their futures. Below you will find a selection of 12 stories. (Interviews have been edited and condensed for readability.) We also invite you to learn more about how we met our heroes, and to listen along to what’s playing in their headphones.
