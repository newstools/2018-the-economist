IN 2001 Allan Treiman, a researcher at the Lunar and Planetary Institute, in Houston, was working on the one-sentence summary that the annual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (LPSC) requires of presenting authors when inspiration struck. To communicate the essence of a paper entitled “The ALTA II Spectrometer: a Tool for Teaching About Light and Remote Sensing”, he wrote down: Bright leaves on dark skyBeyond the brilliant rainbowVision fades away The next year Ralph Lorenz, another planetary scientist, followed his lead, summarising “Tectonic Titan: Landscape Energetics and the Thermodynamic Efficiency of Mantle Convection” thus: And thus was a tradition born. The astronomical followers of Basho have multiplied until, this year, more than 200 of the papers at LPSC have such haiku summaries. Some are purely descriptive: Some impart lessons: Others ask questions both scientific… …and ethical: And some go beyond the fun of an in-joke or the satisfaction of word play to evoke a sense of change and cycles very fitting to the form and the orbiting subject matter, as in Renee Weber’s summation of “Thermal Moonquakes: Implications for Surface Properties”:
