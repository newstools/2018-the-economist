ITALY’S general election on March 4th has left president Sergio Mattarella and party leaders with a daunting puzzle to solve. As the chart shows, the Five Star Movement (M5S) emerged from the vote as Italy’s biggest party while a centre-right bloc including the Northern League, Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party and two smaller outfits was the most successful electoral coalition. But no one party or alliance is expected to have a majority in either house of parliament – and Italy’s next government will need to control both. The arithmetic points to either a populist partnership between the M5S and the League or a coalition of the M5S and the centre-left Democratic Party (PD). On the day after the vote, Matteo Salvini of the League said, however, that he would not take his party into “strange coalitions” and insisted the right could govern alone. But he left the door ajar by stressing his willingness to talk to anyone. The M5S’s candidate for prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, also sounded a conciliatory note. Still, the objective difficulties are considerable. Though often bracketed as populist, and sharing a similarly dim view of the EU, the pacifist, environmentalist M5S and the hard right League differ on many issues. A deal between the M5S and the PD might be easier to strike, but it might be political suicide for the centre-left to go from government to playing second fiddle to a movement largely composed of political ingénues. A broad coalition of the PD and the right would have the numbers, but could men and women of the left really work in harmony with someone as hostile to the euro and irregular immigration as Mr Salvini? Mr Matterella will need all the diplomatic skills he can muster to make Italy governable.
