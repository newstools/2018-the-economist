"Physics was invented and built by men, it's not by invitation," said Alessandro Strumia at CERN, Europe’s nuclear-research centre, earlier this week. He went on to reveal plenty more tone-deaf and sexist views (at a colloquium on gender and physics, no less) before being summarily suspended. There is, alas, a nugget of insight in Dr Strumia’s comment. Physics, and the rest of the physical sciences, started as all-male affairs and most sub-disciplines remain male-dominated even today. Achieving gender parity in the higher echelons of research, where Nobel-worthy work gets done, remains a distant challenge. That there have been fewer Nobel prizes awarded to female scientists is therefore, in part, an issue of demographics and history: the prizes are often given for work done decades previously, when gender imbalances were even more pronounced. That said, the proportion of science Nobels given to women remains woeful. Donna Strickland, one of this year’s physics laureates, was the first woman to receive the prize in 55 years, and only the third in the prize’s history. The Nobel Foundation has at last taken the issue in hand, and from this year the scientists who suggest contenders will be specifically encouraged to nominate female scientists; half of the prize committees themselves are now led by women. Increasingly, physics and the sciences more broadly are being built by women, no invitation required. Honouring them with a fair share of science’s biggest accolades, it is hoped, is a matter of time.
