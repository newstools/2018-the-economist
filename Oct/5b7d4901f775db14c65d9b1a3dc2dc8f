WORLDWIDE, old people are far more likely than any other age group to kill themselves. But in Britain they have become among the least likely. Between 1986 and 2017 the suicide rate among the over-60s dropped by about 60%. This trend puzzles experts, but several changes may help to explain why British pensioners are less likely to kill themselves. One is that their quality of life has got much better. The number of old people living in poverty is close to its lowest-ever level. After housing costs, their incomes almost equal those of working households, a radical change from the mid-1990s, when the elderly were far poorer than others. Their health is also much improved. Better diagnosis and treatment of mental illness, in particular, has helped, since around 90% of suicides involve disorders like depression. Tackling these illnesses benefits all age groups. But some measures are especially good for older patients. One is prescribing anti-depressants, which some studies suggest are most effective at reducing suicidal thoughts among the elderly. Doctors have got better at spotting dementia, which can make people suicidal. And better painkillers mean chronic conditions such as arthritis are less debilitating, and therefore less of a strain on mental health. Fit pensioners are less lonely than invalids, since they get out and socialise more. Read more in “One foot out of the grave” from the Britain section
