 From the 15-year-old captain of Afghanistan’s female high-school robotics team to a former South Sudanese child soldier turned hip-hop artist, the desire for free speech is found in every country but exists in precious few. Naila Zahin Ana, a Bangladeshi blogger, wishes to write without fear of mob retaliation or assassination—as has happened to her friends and colleagues. Fred Bauma, a pro-democracy activist in Congo jailed for 18 months for organising a rally, wishes “to talk about anything, any subject without fearing any retaliation or any intimidation”. Natalia Kaliada, who leads an underground theatre movement in Belarus, the last remaining dictatorship in Europe, wishes to talk about “every single taboo subject that exists in our country”. People in the West often take these liberties for granted. Yet in most places, speaking freely is punished or invites violence. At the annual Oslo Freedom Forum, The Economist’s Open Future team interviewed speakers and attendees about their personal struggles for human rights and free speech. Their responses are edited to around a minute each.
